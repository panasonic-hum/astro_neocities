I played Aggro Crab's previous game, Going Under, which I enjoyed and loved the writing for, so I was down to play Another Crab's Treasure even though it is a soulslike and I'm bad at video games. While I do enjoy "getting good" as they say, I have my limits (typically 5 tries before anger sets in) so I played with some of the helpful assist settings on. I really loved this game! One of my favorite games is Pikmin and this world has the same "alien species describes human objects and finds uses for them" charm with the underwater crab cities laid out with CVS receipt paper streets and the shells scattered around for me to use. These poor creatures are getting our trash dump onto them and they're making the most of it.

The world and gameplay is engaging and fun and deserves a ton of love, but I think what touched me the most is the story of an ecosystem being so warped by pollution that they've become unfazed by it. The pollution corrupts the crabs and makes them sick, but the microplastics remain the currency in crabitalism. It's a political narrative that doesn't become overly didactic and it zigged on me when I thought I had it figured out. I was so sure that defeating the crabitalist would be the story's conclusion, but of course this whole problem doesn't start and end with him! A fantastic little game <3

## Misc notes

- This was the first game I've ever got all achievements in Steam on! I'm proud of that.
- I struggle with Chitan's advice to not let the anger consume you, but I heard the advice and I will try.
- I particularly enjoyed the old tech and styrofoam that made it to the old ocean. A nice visual storytelling and a reminder how much we've damaged this earth.
