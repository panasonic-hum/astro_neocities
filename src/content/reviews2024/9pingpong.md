## Ping Pong

I get really excited when a medium pushes against the limitations of itself. Sports manga can be a great example of this, considering how much sports involve movement and action which can be a challenge to properly illustrate. Ping Pong showed me how much value can be added within the pages to make a sports story dynamic in the confines of a manga panel. I’ve only read Haikyuu before this and that series does a good job of not completely confusing the reader, but Ping Pong was such a step up action wise compared to Haikyuu (no hate!). So much was conveyed by sound effects and paneling that added this dynamism that blew me away.

And again, I’m comparing the two as Haikyuu (and the Initial D anime) are my only touchstones for sports anime and manga, but Ping Pong decidedly not being the kind of “hard work pays off!” cheeriness of more typical sports series was so fun. Sports can really be anything at any given moment, it can hold high highs and low lows, and this series has these ping pong players in the damn trenches a lot of the time and I loved it. Talent only gets you so far in sports and the rest is achieved by torturing yourself day in and day out until your body can’t take it anymore, and that’s a grim way to live!

This manga went in a lot of directions I wasn’t really expecting, but I loved every nuance and detail Matsumoto-sensei added. I’m really excited to read more of his works because even though the art is (thinking of a polite euphemism) _stylized_ very much like an early Adult Swim animated show, I think it captures emotion in ways you don’t initially expect it will and his storytelling is top notch.

## Misc notes
- I'll be a bit vague to avoid spoilers, but it speaks to the skill of the story that I wasn’t expecting a certain early story beat to come back, that made me so happy
- I truly love all my temperamental ping pong high schoolers, but Wenge won me over with the “worst shock since I emerged from the womb” line
- “being good at a sport you loathe” has really gotta be one of the more mundane and miserable afflictions possible and I love that this series explored that a bit
