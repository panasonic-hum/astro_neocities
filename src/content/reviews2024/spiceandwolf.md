I was so happy to hear that Spice and Wolf was getting a reboot where they will (hopefully) finish the series this time. I watched the short lived original series a while back, so happy to have Holo and Lawrence back in my life. Spice and Wolf is what happens when you are a nice, upstanding merchant and you end up rizzing the wolf girl and snag yourself a wolf gf. It's largely a romance anime, but it heavily revolves around trade and mercantilism as well. It's honestly refreshing to have a series set in medieval times that isn't centered on battles, it makes the series stand out and offer something new.

Lawrence and Holo have such a playful, flirty relationship with dialogue that bounces between them. They kinda live at an 11 on the emotion scale, going between light, quick chats to heated arguments or disagreements. Holo is certainly fiery (which is why I love her) and Lawrence can get grumpy, but it never feels like a drag or miserable to see them at their worst, rather it creates a deep character portrait of them as people and a couple. I am pretty picky about romance, but Spice and Wolf gets an enthusiastic thumbs up from me.

## Misc notes

- Holo is the most tsundere a woman can be before I find it annoying
- I'm very pro-dub for this series, I adore J. Michael Tatum and Brina Palencia as Lawrence and Holo
