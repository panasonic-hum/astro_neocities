This was a friend spooky movie night pick so I went into it pretty blind. So much to enjoy here: gorgeous 90s anime scenery, fun fights, interesting characters. I'm not a horror fan so maybe this is uncommon but still well known vampire additional lore, but D being a half-vampire was so cool. Of course it sort of parallels the main story, but D's daddy issues manifesting so severely that he becomes a vampire hunter was the perfect wrinkle for a pretty mysterious fellow.

This movie also had great pacing. The story unfolded right on time for the acts and I never felt a distracting lull. I would recommend this as a spooky movie watch (I still do), but it is now November, so maybe put it on the list next year. Also, I need to watch more 90s anime because its style is one of a kind and I adore it! If this plot sucked, I still would've enjoyed seeing the scenery.

## Misc notes

- This is a sequel, but it was easy to follow without seeing the previous one
- I was fully bracing for a bad woman character in Leila, but she's actually the best of the human vampire hunters.
- The dark, brooding D would've done numbers on Tumblr if this came out in 2014
