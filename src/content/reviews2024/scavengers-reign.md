A sci-fi survival story exploring a beautiful, yet hostile world after a ship and its crew crash land on it. It's a bit of a biological horror, a bit emotional exploration, it's a story of survival through connection and community. The world building was so impressive! So many fascinating creatures and stunning animation, way more than I was expecting. It kinda reminded me of Spore, the creatures were sort of round and colorful and odd in much the way those little pals in Spore looked to me.

The suspense, the joy, the anger, the love, Scavengers Reign is a charcuterie board of extreme emotions. It reminded me a bit of one of my favorite watches of 2023, Station Eleven, where we see the full spectrum of kindness and cruelty of humans in times of crisis. I would've loved to see what else this team had in mind for the future with this story but thanks to the assholes at HBO MAX, we will probably never know.

## Misc notes

- Joining the small but mighty chorus "pick up Scavengers Reign season 2" someone, please
- I don't typically hate characters, but the way I hate Kamen...evil worm
- Ursula was so lovely! Happy to have a curious scientist character
