Doughnuts Under a Crescent was a short, sweet yuri series that I really enjoyed. I appreciate a short read (this is only 4 volumes and took me about a week to finish), but I do feel like there was more to explore here and the series ended a bit too soon. It ends right as they get together, which I guess is a logical ending spot, but I would've loved to see how their relationship grew and developed after the love confession.

The characters here occupy a perfect zone where they do not annoy me with pointless miscommunication, but also aren't so perfect and frictionless that there's nothing interesting going on. They are adults with jobs who have fears and anxiety to work through, but they can talk to each other about them. I realized a little too late that I should've been paying attention to the lunar cycle (it's even in the damn title!), but I think this happens in the span of a month with the titular crescent moon making a return at the end. I liked that and the extended donut metaphor, it was lovely.

## Misc notes

- Subaru was probably my favorite character
- I love how everyone has flaws but isn't super awful or anything, it was nice
