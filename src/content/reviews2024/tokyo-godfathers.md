Naturally, I had to end Satoshi Kon 2024 with Tokyo Godfathers for Christmas :) Three homeless people find a baby on Christmas Eve and take it in and care for it. This movie is so incredibly funny, sentimental, and absurd and lovingly plays with the themes and iconography of Christmas. I love the way it weaves the story beats through this sort of domino effect, dictated by fate in a way that feels magical, very befitting a holiday like Christmas. I am a Christmas hater, but this was a lovely story that connects itself to the very special miracle feeling Christmas has in the movies and tv.

I think it did a great job exploring the varied personal struggles of Hana, Gin, and Miyuki and the circumstances that caused them to have nowhere else to go. This journey on Christmas Eve brings them back to their mistakes and lets them reconnect with family in a really lovely way. A great balance of sentimental but not overly saccharine.

## Misc notes

- Hana is an icon and the moment, love her
- The big final scene and the line about being blessed by God brought such a smile to my face, lovely
- Between this and Perfect Blue, Satoshi must've found odd and unhinged women so fascinating
