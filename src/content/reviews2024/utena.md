Revolutionary Girl Utena is an absolute trip of a show. It's surreal and avant-garde and also incredibly relatable, surprisingly. Being a teen sucks and somehow under all of the supernatural, unexplainable, bizarre cult things going on in the show, its core is still a story about growing up and about losing an innocence that you had. These teen insecurities, difficult and complex feelings, filter through a fantastical society and become magnified. You're self conscious about your crush becomes cause for a duel, fighting for attention becomes wrapped up in revolution and the end of the world.

It is certainly not a perfect show, the pacing is a bit uneven, but it plays with episodic structure a lot throughout the show in a unique way. Most episodes have a similar plot structure, so much that it did become boring to me halfway through season 3, but that repetitve storytelling made any deviations that much more exciting and incredible to me. It's unlike most other TV I've seen and it was so fascinating to experience, which you should read as high praise as someone who has seen a lot of tv and anime. There's a number of content warnings to be aware of with RGU as it does handle a lot of tough subjects, but I fully support watching this bizarre show.

## Misc notes

- Not to pit two bad bitches against each other, but why does Neon Genesis Evangelion get all the love in the anime community when RGU is honestly _more_ weird and offbeat and depressing...where is the love for RGU?!?
- Finally got jumpscared by anime incest, which I had mostly managed to avoid in all my anime watching
- TOXIC YURI REAL????????????
