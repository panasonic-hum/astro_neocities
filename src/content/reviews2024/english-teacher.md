I mostly checked out English Teacher because I watched The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo forever ago and enjoyed it a lot, so I was down to check out a new Brian Jordan Alvarez and Stephanie Koenig project. The show has a good balance of earnestness and bite, which feels appropriate for the moment. It's incredibly funny, incisive, and a bit bonkers. Its political observations of teaching in a conservative state is well done but not exhaustingly so. Evan is confident and his existence as a gay teacher is a political act, but he's also a teacher trying to get his students to read The Red Badge of Courage.

I was surprised how much I ended up enjoying Markie because he seemed like the meathead teacher who was disliked by everyone, but he's not as one dimensional as I feared he'd be. I hate when there's just that one character who exists as the punching bag. The dynamic of Markie and Evan as coworkers who are friends, but also who get on each other's nerves felt well observed to me. They have differing opinions that lead them to butting heads, but Markie is a good friend to Evan and vice versa.

## Misc notes

- I almost screamed with joy when Enrico Colatoni showed up, he's incredible as the beleaguered principal who simply wants to be left alone
- I like a show set in a high school that has minimal teens in it
- The Austin setting could've been used more tbh, it didn't feel particularly Austin
