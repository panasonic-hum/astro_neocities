Girls5eva feels like the little show that could and it feels a bit miraculous that it made it to season 3. It's switched networks since it first aired in 2021 and has short seasons, even for streaming comedies, that get dropped in one go, and yet it survives and is as fun as ever. It's a bit more reflective of the Girls5eva group as women reinventing themselves and forcefully carving their own way through an industry that left them on the metaphorical side of the road a long time ago. This season was funny and sweet like it always is and the finale always makes me smile. If you love fun and laughing and silly songs written by Sara Bareilles, you must watch Girls5eva.  
  
On a small side rant...I hate the "season all at once" model and I can't believe it still persists! I watched this season all in one day (look I GET that I am complaining about habits I myself am doing but I don't have good self-control, it's not on me) and I had completely forgotten I even watched this until I was scrolling through my Serializd reviews. TV isn't meant to be like this!!!  

## Misc notes
* I'm not good at reviewing comedies because I usually like them or I don't and I don't put a ton of thought into them structurally or comedy wise, but yes! a fun show
* Wickie fills the Jenna Maroney sized hole in my heart
* the theme song is so incredible and fully jams itself into my brain for days after I finish it
