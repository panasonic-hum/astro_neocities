First off, I just wanna say that I've been reading Dandadan for a few years now (I think I started when it was 50 chapters in) so I'm an early investor. It was an easy sell, I have a soft spot for the paranormal, so I was excited to see some of my favorite panels animated. I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the animation and the creative direction of the project. I saw an interview with the director before I watched the first episode of the anime and when I saw how dedicated he was to direction and visual storytelling,that's when I knew we were in good hands. They animate camera techniques! They animated a dolly zoom! It feels like such a breath of fresh air visually and is unique in the anime landscape. I'm looking forward to seeing what this team has in store for season 2. The direction stood out to me the most, but all parts of this series, from the voice acting and the OP and ED, are top notch.

This is more a critique of the source material than the anime, but good lord there's an excessive amount of sexual violence in this series. I get that this is a dark series and that it's a brutal and uncomfortable reality, but the vibes can teeter closer to an inartful exploration of it. Even with that, the series does a good job of balancing that darkness with lighter, high school centric moments. I have apparently forgotten large swaths of this manga but I do believe this lessens with time. Which is good because it was a big shock when it came time to watch the anime, like right in the pilot episode. A shame Tatsu is so good at drawing creepy aliens and terrifying ghosts because he would write a great romance manga (ok sure, Dandadan could be classified as that).

## Misc notes

- This x files high school au is wild
- Ending the season on an arc setup episode is such a weird choice, but at least it's coming back soon
- "A Kinder World" fucked me up so bad....I had somehow memory holed that arc since I read it a few years ago
