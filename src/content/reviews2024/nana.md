Nana had been on my to read list, but what pushed me over was this [Nana "Good Luck, Babe" AMV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99s9MAUREg4). I really didn't know what to expect going into the series, but it's a lot darker than I was expecting it to be. Not a problem for me, and angst enjoyer, except that I was praying for Takumi's death the entire time. I was so drawn in by the rest of the cast of complex disaster characters otherwise.

All of the characters are so flawed and human and encapsulate all of that anxiety and foolishness that drives so much of your early adulthood. People that have convinced themselves that they don't need to rely on anyone and that they have everything figured out when they're lost and confused children. Nana really captures that messiness of early adulthood well, but also shows the closeness and importance of these friendships. The Nanas meeting by chance on the train and then at the apartment viewing and that turning into a deep friendship is really what living is all about! Even when things fall apart, neither is far from the other's mind. It's called Nana for a reason and it's because that friendship is what's most important!

## Misc notes

- MULTIPLE TIMES when reading this I thought "I am so glad to not be 20 anymore", it's exhausting!!!
- 15 years is too long for a hiatus, maybe we should just say ended now
- Yasu is kinda the perfect man
