## Lodge 49  

Lodge 49 heard my pleas for fewer TV dramas about rich people and more stories about people living on the edge of a broken economic system who are close to tipping over. Lodge 49 is not just about economic precarity and the dying of the American middle class, but about loss and death generally. The focus of the story is on Liz and Dud, who lost their father a year ago and have been struggling a lot with it. They both have bizarre ways to cope with the grief, but Dud joins an esoteric Lodge order and becomes interested in alchemy.  
  
This show is so unique when you think about other shows that aired alongside it during the prestige tv era boom, for the content matter sure, but also it’s such a beautiful exploration of the multifaceted experience of loss and grief. There’s the loss of the person, but there’s a loss of you and the person you were when they were around as if your life is so clearly segmented into a before and after. Almost every character in the show is experiencing some type of loss, a person, their health, or their job, and the show has such a focus and dedication to exploring this experience. Pair this with the show's bizarre, almost anachronistic secret society, the Lynx, and you get a show with a fresh perspective and something fascinating to say instead of Prestige TV HBO Drama Number 58 about how gross rich people are but also how much we kind of want to be them? There are few things I appreciate more than a show that tries something new, even when it's not completely nailing it (which Lodge 49 does have a way better handle on what about it works by s2).  

## Misc notes

- I found s1 a bit uneven, but s2 was really incredible stuff
- It’s **such** a shame it was canceled so early when it had so much more to say! I will accept some responsibility for not tuning in while it was airing; I watched the pilot but it didn’t grab me.
- I definitely recommend this show, but I get there’s just so much out there :( but check it out if any of that spoke to you!!!
