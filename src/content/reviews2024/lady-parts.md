It was a long wait between seasons 1 and 2 and I had honestly started to give up hope of ever seeing s2, but then one day...it finally arrived. Much is said (rightfully!) about the premise of a punk band of Muslim women, but I think its style and humor really stands out to me. There's whimsy to Amina's inner thoughts that feels familiar and unique to me. A comedic style that's recognizable, but as a Mulsim woman, a character who too frequently isn't given the depth to be funny and playful. We haven't even delved into the fun and genre hopping of the original songs for the band! Much to be said about the crowded and overwhelming TV landscape of the past 10 years, but this show might not have gotten a chance at other points in TV history and that's a shame.

The episode focusing on Saira's struggle to square her radical ideals with being on a label was great TV. There's no easy answer to that dilemma, but it had the added weight of desperately wanting to say something important about Palestine. It felt like meta-commentary from the show's creative team as self-censorship and the regular censorship is common with the Palestinian genocide. It was done well and that lose-lose feeling felt so real. There really wasn't a story line I didn't like, other than I wish we had more time with all the women.

## Misc notes

- Amina is SUCH a fun character! Fully support her on her war against her boss.
- "Villain Era" should be charting if we lived in a just society
- This is the kind of show where I miss longer series because all these women deserve more time to develop their stories
