Golden Kamuy is one of the funniest manga I've ever read. Part historical drama about Japan post-Russo-Japanese war, part slapstick comedy (more like slapdick comedy, am I right?), the thesis of this show is "what's better than this? Just guys being dudes" and said dudes are beating the shit out of each other on their way to find a stash of gold collected by the Ainu. This series was a brilliant exploration of masculinity and the violence that gets brought home once soldiers return from war. There are so many guys in this series, some of who I struggled to keep track of for the more tertiary characters, that you will have a favorite gold hunt faction and you can have some random dude who's in 10 chapters who committed terrible crimes that you become obsessed with.

This series also is the first depiction of Ainu culture I've ever seen. The Ainu character Aspira has ties to the gold and helps Sugimoto in his quest to find it. It was my absolute favorite part to learn about the culture and customs of the Ainu as well as depicting other marginalized indigenous people of Japan and Eastern Russia. There's a bit of sadness about knowing that Aspira's fears of Ainu culture disappearing with modernity creeping in and the suppression and the deliberate erasure of it by the government did come true, but at the same time, this series carries traditions and stories to this modern moment.

## Misc notes

- There is a character that shows up at the big fight at the end and I was SO HAPPY to see them! Like OF COURSE they had to make one final appearance
- Sugimoto isn't the step-father, he's the father who stepped up
- My biggest gripe is that sometimes the story pacing was rough and felt a little meandering, I compared this to sidequests in video games because it felt like we were killing time
