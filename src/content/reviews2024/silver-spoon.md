Hiromu Arakawa, I was familiar with your game AND YET I still slept on this series. I'm a huge fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, but I always assumed that a romcom at an agricultural high school is something that would not vibe with. I've been reading every series by my favorite mangakas, so I decided to at least give it a try. Arakawa's passion and deep knowledge of the farming industry completely shines through, which gives it an authenticity that not everyone could pull off. Sure it's a coming of age romcom, but it has thoughtful conversation on the intertwined fates of farm animals and their keepers. There can be a lot of noise and emotions in discussions on this issue, so it was refreshing to see it discussed with the weight it deserved without some of the sensationalized talking points that get in. We owe animals care and kindness, but animals need us to survive just as much as we use them.

Hachiken's journey to finding a passion after being burned out by the cutthroat academic achievement was so lovely <3. I really don't know why I doubted Arakawa, truly, she's always been fantastic at creating interesting characters with complicated backgrounds going through an emotional journey. Hachiken growing so much from what was supposed to be his plan to flee his stubborn and cold father and the academic rat race, I loved to see it.

## Misc notes
- I love when artists have such a distinctive style that you see a character in another series and it looks so much like one of their other characters
- Dang, there's a lot about rural living that's very universal, I loved that
- Komaba's story arc made me cry <3 I can have some serious and sadness in my high school comedy
