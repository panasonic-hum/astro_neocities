This review is for the manga mostly because I haven't finished the anime yet. I read this forever ago, but after reading 20th Century Boys and being blown away, I decided to reread Monster. I was really surprised that it did not grab me like 20th Century Boys did. I am gonna chalk this up to personal taste, though, because the story is good. Really evil guys in like a true crime way, which is what Johan feels like to me, are just not really something I gravitate towards. Frankly, I didn't find Johan that fascinating, which is largely why I didn't love Monster. There were parts I liked for sure, Kenzo Tenma is a great protagonist and his struggles were compelling, Grimmer is a sweetie pie, and I love my messy drunk legend Eva.

Also, I think I just got really hung up trying to read too much into it to the point where I struggled to engage with what the story was. I couldn't get the idea that the twins were supposed to metaphorically be East and West Germany and thinking this was some meditation on Communism vs Capitalism out of my head, because why else would Urasawa set the series in a recently reunited Germany? This was probably more of a nature vs nuture sociological musing more than anything else. Every father in this series is emotionally unavailable and neglectful to their wives and children and that sort of fractured family structure is a big theme of the story.

## Misc notes

- The only thing I remembered from my first go around was Lunge, which is so funny that his hand tick was so memorable to me, lol
- I don't even need to read anything to know Eva is hated as a messy woman who frequently gets in the male characters' way, but I loved her. What a fantastic, messy, broken woman.
- I'm not sure what the consensus is on the ending, but I did love it.
