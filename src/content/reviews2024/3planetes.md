## Planetes
  
Planetes is undoubtedly a great manga. It has space exploration ennui and celebrates the pursuit of scientific journey into space while discussing the pitfalls of that endeavor. It's a real hard science sci-fi series but doesn't skimp on character development or the emotional interior of the characters. But, to me this series was one where I can recognize all of this and still not enjoy it a lot.  
  
I think my two biggest stumbling blocks is that, despite liking sci-fi, I get easily bored with hard science approaches to it. I like the lofty ideas, but being asked to remember some of the scientific facts provided feels too much like school. The other is that this series came out in 1999 and had big dreams for our future with space exploration and that just does not feel as resonant in our world today. The dreams of a humanity that made it out to space and continues to make incredible leaps forward in space development feels like a bygone era. It's not Planetes' fault that we live now in an incredibly anti-intellectual world now, but it did make getting invested in a series about a near distant space based future difficult. But I’m a cynic who struggles to see a path where space exploration doesn’t pollute the stars beyond recognition, so if this sounds like you would like it, please check it out, it is good.  

### Misc notes

* too busy complaining about space travel losing its novelty to me that I didn't mention the human focused stories in Planetes, but that was my favorite part I just didn't have much to say
* I liked the ending! I think some thought it as abrupt but I disagree
