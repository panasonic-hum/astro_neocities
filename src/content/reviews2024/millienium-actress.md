Satoshi Kon is such a visionary, Millennium Actress was a beautifully crafted masterpiece. It's a unique film about a beloved actress, Chiyoko Fujiwara, who suddenly retired and two documentarians are trying to find out why. We revisit Chikoyo's life and filmography and unravel the secret she's kept for decades by unraveling her filmography that I just loved. It really is a beautifully crafted work of art.

The jumping scenes and timelines took some time adjusting to as it could be hard to locate in what moment of time and place we were in, but I love a director and writer that trusts that I'm smart enough to catch up. The blend of memories and commentary from the documentarians with the movie footage was so fantastic, I was blown away. The movie plots and locations are informed by Chiyoko's personal life, even reflecting this bleeding effect that is _also_ the narrative structure of Millennium Actress itself. It's the kind of movie that makes you think and as someone who honestly doesn't like watching movies that much, this film did a great of keeping my attention and getting me to use my brain to understand thematically what they were trying to capture. ART!

## Misc notes

- Obviously don't want to spoil the moment this whole film builds up to, but the revelation had me laying on my couch just sitting with it for a good 5 minutes
- On a new quest to consume everything Satoshi Kon made, RIP a legend taken too soon
