I'm still on my Satoshi Kon kick, so I watched Paprika with some friends. Definitely my least favorite Satoshi Kon film so far, but that speaks more to the quality of Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress and less to denigrate Paprika. It's creative and visually interesting, but it's less character focused and more driven by plot and action. Which is perfectly fine, but I tend to lean towards character explorations.

Truthfully, I took too long to write this and don't remember my other thoughts on it, lol. A style, medium, and subject matter I don't typically gravitate to, but still a good watch and good movie.

## Misc notes

- I've never seen Inception so I couldn't get mad about it being a ripoff of Paprika (although The Lathe of Heaven was there before both of them)
- I love that his other works get a cameo in the one scene
