After reading Ping Pong earlier this year, I was excited to check out some more Taiyo Matsumoto work and coincidentally, his new work Tokyo These Days was translated this year. This series was a nice treat for me where I would read a chapter or two every few days, it was cozy. It revolves around a manga editor who retired out of embarrassment of his magazine going out of business, but he decides he needs to get some of his favorite mangaka to write for a new magazine he wants to start up.

It's an interesting peek behind the curtain of the manga industry, which is a tough grind of a profession. We get glimpses into the lives of current and retired mangaka, the sort of things that push them away and how capitalism mixing with a joyous pursuit of art can sap their joy. Matsumoto is so brilliant at storytelling and art that I became captivated in the story as I wandered around the Tokyo city streets with Shiozawa, meeting old friends.

## Misc notes

- I adored the final page of the chapters! Such beautiful art of city scenes
- I really feel like I just tagged along on some errands more than I read a story!
