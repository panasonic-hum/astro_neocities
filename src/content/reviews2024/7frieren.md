I try to check out the big anime of the season when it appeals to me because I really enjoy the community that sprouts up and having a little weekly ritual, so I checked out Frieren and it is the perfect shonen series for me. Thematically interesting with its exploration of death and legacy, fun characters and funny moments, and battles that get me excited. It has a wistful, melancholic tone as it focuses on loss and aging as the semi-immortal elf Frieren reminisces on the hero's journey she took with a group of friends to defeat the demon king as she embarks on a new journey with a new group. The anime does a fantastic job handling the nostalgia and reflecting on past times without overwhelming the plot too much and I really enjoyed it. It made me cry, not really out of sadness, but more of a longing, as these are memories and experiences Frieren can't have again since some of her original team have passed. In that sense, it captures the sort of ache that grief leaves behind. But Frieren also has new memories to form with new people and that time she spent with Himmel and the others has taught her what a treasure these moments are.  
  
And the battles are FUN! I wasn't that into the second half with the standard exam style arc that is a shonen cliche, but by the end I really loved getting an expanded view of the mage world. Just enough to add flavor without overwhelming the plot of the series. The characters are fascinating and a lot of fun to spend time with and don't feel like a distraction from the main characters. I think youtuber On the Rise A&V did a great job of explaining what makes Frieren appeal to so many types of anime fans in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGPPeAb2PGQ) that I recommend if you want to hear someone explain it better than me. But your takeaway here is that you should watch Frieren!!!  

## Misc notes  

- I miss my Frieren Fridays already!
- People talk a lot about Himmel and Frieren's relationship, but we need more discussions on how delightfully weird Fern and Frieren's mentor/mentee relationship is! It's like anime Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy TO ME
- Everybody pisses Fern off...she's so relatable
