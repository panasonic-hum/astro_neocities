## Basara

Basara was both "a mangaka I like" with Yumi Tamura and "a big name shojo series" so it was pretty high up on my to read list. Basara captivated me immediately and held my attention to the end (minus the post-series stuff which isn't really my speed anyway). One noticeable difference between shojo and shonen manga is how much more work goes into conveying emotion and moments as opposed to big speeches or plot points. Basara has plenty of big plot moments that got me excited or pushed the story forward effectively and skillfully, but it's also a series that takes the time to give us a whole page of Sarasa or Shuri processing an emotional moment or revelation and is just as interested in the emotional story for the characters. I love long form storytelling precisely because I love seeing characters grow and change and this series did a great job of managing a large ensemble of Tatara's army, the royalty, and Shuri's orbit and their growth throughout the manga.  
  
Basara features a world that is ruled by a monarchy that imposes cruelty and violence that has people trapped and devalued in a hierarchical society that is on the precipice of a revolution, as one woman is destined to change the tide of history. But even more importantly, Basara wants to explore what's beyond the hate and the revenge that fuels a revolutionary movement. Do we have space for rage and hate against those who've wronged us or do we stay trapped in a cycle of violence? Is there a way out that gives us justice and peace? It's a hard question to ask when rage and violence feeds a very visceral feeling in us and peace and forgiveness (not in the annoying "turn the other cheek" way but in the thoughtful “the peace within yourself demands it” way) do not. It still is hard to let that desire for revenge go so I'm not sure if the story completely got me there opinion wise, but it gave me a lot to ruminate on and I enjoy that very much. It felt like the ending the series deserved even if I think that line of thinking re: forgiveness doesn’t give the people who suffered the justice they deserve.  

## Misc notes
* slight spoiler, but I truly can't believe Nachi and Hijiri didn't get married at the end...fujoshis in the 90s I mourned with you
* Viz when will you reprint this series, I NEED IT
* Shuri never really won me over (partially out of stubbornness on my part), but his character arc never felt forced or unearned and I really appreciated it
* I adored all of the tiny Tam Tam times, it's so fun to get insights into Yumi Tamura's life in the 90s and it really added a layer to the story to see these brief inner moments of her life as she wrote this amazing series
