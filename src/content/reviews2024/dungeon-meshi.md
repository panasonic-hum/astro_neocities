Please reference my Frieren review about my penchant about the big anime of the season. Anyway, I had quite the journey with Dungeon Meshi. I went it knowing it was about eating in a dungeon, which is mostly true. Of course, the first couple of episodes feel like that is the entire show, so I thought that it was just a slice of life series about that, which is not my bag at all. And when you think that is what the series is, it gives off a weird vibe that they start out trying to save Falin and then they all get distracted by cooking. Like, aren't y'all worried about y'all's friend? Who is in the guts of a dragon??? It takes a few episodes, but they finally make headway and there is a sense of expected urgency to the quest. I'm not sure if "tone problem" is the best way to describe this, but there is some incongruency there.

Once the show got going, it vibed with me more. It's funny, has great characters, and has enough gruesome moments to keep me on my toes. Between this and Frieren, medieval fantasy is back in a big way. The characters feel surprisingly modern! Feel like I could've been in a geometry class with Laios or talked shit about Marcille (sorry girl but I just know you were insufferable in high school).

## Misc notes

- I cannot find the original tweet, but the "Gainax bounce after killing six people" tweet is always my first thought when thinking of the show, a true visionary posted that
- Idk if it's mostly the absence, but only really learning about Falin from the people who love her is interesting because, much like some of the other characters, I do feel like "...y'all're doing all this, for her?" she's fine I guess.
- That one meal Senshi has to eat to learn some life altering lore was so funny and also so fucked up like!!! exactly the tone I want from my anime
