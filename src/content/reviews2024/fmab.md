More than just being my favorite anime, FMAB is one of my favorite series. Heartbreak and joy, despair and hope, it is a true triumph of people working together and overcoming an evil government and saving humanity. I cannot fit all my thoughts into this little review so please know they are vast. I have reread and rewatched FMA multiple times now and it only gets better each time. It's a story that grows with you and there's so many complexities about the story that resonate more as you get older. A government that serves interests other than its citizens? Characters making massive mistakes because they believed the lies their government espoused? That's not Amestris, that's the the United States government!

There really isn't a character who doesn't get a good character arc in the series. My personal favorite is Roy and Riza's struggle to atone for their war crimes, even believing atonement is not possible for them. It's a framing that isn't really common (especially in American media) where the aggressors are less looking for forgiveness and instead accepting that their actions were brutal and cannot be undone, but that they can change their actions going forward. There are others, but exploring all of them would make this entry take up 90% of the page, so please just watch it yourselves and experience Peak.

## Misc notes

- This whole review could've been a beat by beat analysis of Roy and Riza's relationship, but I will save that for another day...(threat)
- I watched the sub for the first time and WOW Edward is so much more enjoyable when he's not voiced by Vic Mignogna
- My most nitpicky thing is that I think other Ishvalan perspectives besides Scar would've been good to explore
- Actually, my nitpicky thing about Brotherhood specifically is that the Youswell arc was important! It's Ed's first character growth moment!
