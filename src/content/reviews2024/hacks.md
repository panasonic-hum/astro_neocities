Based on the ending of season 2 putting Deborah and Ava on different paths, I was curious how the two of them would reconnect in season 3. The show works best when the two of them are working together, so it wasn't a matter of "if" but "how" they would reuinte after the tough breakup. There is a delicate balance to maintaining the edge to a comedy show over time and I wasn't sure if the sharp edges of Deborah or Ava would be dulled. I'm glad they are still the messy, complicated, and occasionally cruel people they were in season 1 because as much as they've changed and improved each other, they find it hard to commit to the change completely.

I don't mean this as faint praise, but I was surprised that Hacks found interesting plot lines to explore for so many of its characters. It feels more common that a streaming show begins to spin its wheels around this point, but the writers pushed characters that had been static characters like Marcus or Kathy, into the spotlight more and made them more than just moons around Deborah's planet. I'm excited to see where this show goes.

## Misc notes

- The ENDING got my ass, like jaw on floor
- I was a bit surprised how much I liked the Kayla and Jimmy sutff this season as they're usually the boring B-plots, but there was some good character dynamics with them
- FANTASTIC acting from Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder
