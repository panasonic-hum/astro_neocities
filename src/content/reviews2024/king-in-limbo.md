It's really easy to convince me to check out a manga series if it's less than 5 volumes, which with the 2-in-1s that got published in English, King in Limbo is only 3 volumes. The story was well paced, so the 3 volumes were a great length. There's a sleeping disease that can only be cured by jumping into the affected's unconscious and the genius, Rune Winter, must be lured out for one last job. Solid premise and with great characters, I really enjoyed this series.

My one critique here is that the villain felt like a dart throw to decide who would be behind the virus. The story tries to zag from the person who seems selfish and shady to someone we didn't have any reason to suspect. It really didn't make a lot of narrative or emotional sense based on what we saw of them. I wouldn't say it changed my opinion of the story that much as I felt the plot and world building was interesting otherwise, but it definitely felt "meh" to me.

## Misc notes

- if I can briefly be nitpicky...it gave me a chuckle that this was set in the US but two British mannerisms leaked through. Americans don't count on their hands with thumb first and we don't do Christmas crackers. Thank you for letting me point that out annoyingly.
- "Rune Winter" is SUCH an anime American name, I loved it
- The shock of my life finding out Rune's wife knew him when he was a child...um, well I don't care much for this woman now
