I actually started this before Lost Lad London (it's the same mangaka) and Glitch is the reason I checked out Lost Lad London, but this series just finished publishing in English. Glitch reminds me partially of the offbeat but unphased tone of _Welcome to Night Vale_ where the glitches in the town are not noticed or shrugged off by the local residents. This series is a mix of scifi and a bit of a conspiracy unwinding type of plot, which are two of my favorite things. It's only 4 volumes, so not a long read and I found it enjoyable.

The characters were all great and interesting. It was nice how strongly the kids felt about justice and doing what's right to help those who ended up stuck in their world and it was nice to see them supported by kind adults in their orbit. The community had some faults, but they mostly worked together to help and protect themselves from the danger, as opposed to the developers and government choosing not to concern themselves with the odd going ons. There is a clear understanding of political power that is mentioned even if this isn't an overtly political story in that "everything is political" way.

## Misc notes

- it had an understated humor to it!
- Something very soothing about the panel layout, simple but effective
- I feel like there were some unanswered questions in the series that I would've preferred an answer for
