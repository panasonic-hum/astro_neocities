Norco is a point and click game set in a futuristic southern Louisiana that doesn't feel that different from current southern Louisiana. The game has a fantastic southern gothic vibe to it that perfectly explores the forces of decay and desctruction that dominate so much of the gulf region. The large oil company dominating not only the visual landscape of the region, but touches the personal lives of practically everyone you meet, the environmental degradation brought on by development and timber harvesting, and the looming shadow of slavery.

This is a great narrative game that captures the spirit of southern Louisiana fantastically and presents the draw of this area to people who are unfamiliar with it. For some, like Kay's mom, the corrupt and dangerous swamps are all they know, but for others, like Kay, fleeing is only a temporary measure. Your hometown always stays with you even if it's a curse you'd rather be rid of. I found the story lines with Catherine particularly emotional. There was such an evocative spiritual center to the story that felt heavy, with occasional flashes of lightness.

## Misc notes

- The writing was spectacular, the prose captured such a lovely and haunting image of a region. of people, of fractures
- This game isn't too long, it was a nice weekend playthrough
- Honestly I don't play many narrative games, but this game made me reconsider that.
