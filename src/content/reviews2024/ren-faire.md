Ren Faire isn't _not_ a documentary -- it is observing events in the management of the largest Renaissance Festival in the US -- but it reminded me more of reality tv. Not staged to that level, but there are a number of scenes that feel like the team pitched an idea and the subjects rolled with it. It's more a look of the power dynamics when you blend an egotistical old man with a profitable business with those around him vying for the power he's trying to cede for retirement.

Unfortunately, we've all dealt with mercurial bosses who were a total pain in the ass, but seeing all these people grin and bear it and in some cases, come back to it all after getting fired, was really illuminating. I felt like I was learning so much more about these strangers than they ever meant to willingly show us. It is demeaning, sure, but I think there's also this inescapable pull of a job where you tie so much of your life into that makes all this feel normal and not deeply warped. The camera direction did a great job of silently commenting on all of this and it made it so compelling.

My favorite person featured was Jeff, who I think was the only person that really understood George. Darla and Louie wanted something from George and falsely believed they could convince him to do what they wanted, but Jeff knew that isn't how this place worked. That George probably is incapable of retiring and that to survive, you have to learn to tolerate him. Fantastic psychological look at how the gears fit together in a small business tyrant's company.

## Misc notes

- The "George has mommy issues" reveal was so illuminating, truly everything clicked into place here
- As a fellow Astros fan, I adored the 2022 World Series cameos
- I cackled every time Darla said "George wants to retire" now we all know that's not true...
