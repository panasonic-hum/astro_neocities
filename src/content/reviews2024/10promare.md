Promare is beautiful visually, with vibrant colors and a very geometric animation look that I really enjoyed. The fights were fun and visually loud, maybe overwhelmingly loud by the end, and the characters were fun and charismatic (minus Forsight who was undercooked imo).  
  
All that being said, this story was so cliche and muddled in the final act that it started to really irritate me. It didn't have much else to say about oppression that I haven't seen explored somewhere else at a deeper level. It felt like it was all flash and little substance. The conflict between Forsight and Lio just gets papered over by Big Himbo Firefighter's singular moral clarity that anyone dying is Bad and you don't get the sense anyone will be held accountable for the pain caused by the oppression of the Burnish.  
  
## Misc notes
- When I visit family I end up passively consuming Paw Patrol and I could not stop seeing the similarities
- I would've liked them to dig into Heris's storyline a bit more
- All the character names were so top tier, great job folks
