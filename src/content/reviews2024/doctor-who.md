FIRST OF ALL: we did not need to make ANOTHER "season 1" of Doctor Who! We should've just gone up to season (or series for the Brits) 14, it would've been fun.

Doctor Who is a series I pop in and out of fairly regularly, but I had caught up in time to watch "The Power of the Doctor" in 2022. I was excited for the return of RTD and was interested in seeing how Ncuti works as the Doctor (I am more partial to older Doctors but coming into it with an open mind). After watching the season, I think those two thoughts flipped. Ncuti blew me away as the Doctor, he carried the role so well. Fifteen brought a lot of joy to the series, which has gotten a bit bogged down in Tortured Alien Yelling territory lately (circa 2005 IF we're all being honest....I do love angst though but we need some new recipes). He brings so much life to the role. Some of the writing felt a bit muddled to me, but I think there's always some growing pains with a new Doctor and companion. The finale was a bit "meh", but some of the earlier episodes hit the right note of daring for me personally.

## Misc notes

- Standouts for me were "The Devil's Chord" and "Rogue"
- A shout out to "73 Yards" which I found kinda confusing BUT I did love the horror/folk genre getting some love
- Fifteen reminded me of Nine and I loved that! Idk how intentional that was
