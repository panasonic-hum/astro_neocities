I don't think there's an easy way to explain why I enjoyed Shōgun so much. Sure the story was compelling, the sets were beautiful, and the acting was phenomenal, but it felt like it had more to do with an aura. Everything about the show was just so well done that it felt like watching a beautifully pitched baseball game almost. I think my thoughts on it are still being processed by my brain, to be honest. I do think I would've enjoyed it if I watched after it finished airing, but having the ritual of tuning in weekly and having to wait a week to see what would happen made the experience that much more special to me. 
  
Shōgun seems to be getting a lot of praise and comparison to game of Thrones due to the plotting and scheming in the show, both of which are fair, but I think the more interesting parts for me was the cultural exchange going on between Blackthorne and the Japanese. There is a certain "fish out of water" nature to it, but it feels more similar to how The Americans worked really hard to show an ideology unlike the primary audiences' own to force them to consider their ideals more closely. Blackthorne left his family in London to seek personal glory while Mariko was the only member of her family left alive to serve a greater purpose. It's the disagreement at the heart of the show, for the two characters and for the (Western) audience to me: that in Japan at this time, life is cheap and that in death you achieve something greater than yourself. It really isn't even that Westerners don't think life is cheap, since historically we haven't been inclinced to help those being oppressed (but that's a longer, offtopic conversation), but our sentiments on being part of a greater whole and the "sanctity of life (for privileged people historically)" are different and the show made we really ruminate on these ideals a lot.


## Misc notes
- I loved everything they did with Mariko-sama! Incredible acting, incredible story arc, 10 out of 10
- That Scene in episode 8 quite literally had me on the edge of my seat, man that was fantastic acting
- I found out it was a miniseries before the penultimate episode and I pre-mourned my loss...sorry but I needed more
