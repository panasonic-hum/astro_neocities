The Diplomat is a lot of fun! I do not think this is essential tv, it's a solid B show, but man is it so fun. I love the disaster couple that Hal and Kate are, I love the absurd plots they somehow get enmeshed in while trying to be ambassador in the UK, I just love how over the top this show is. It does a great job of keeping the tone serious and the plotting intriguing without making it feel super self-serious and bogged down like shows that think they're Important Prestige tv tend to do.

The Diplomat brings me Keri Russell looking disheveled and gorgeous, Rufus Sewell charming and reckless, and the always lovely to see Allison Janney! I wouldn't say that I find the questions this show, and political shows in general, likes to bring up as interesting and important societal questions because they always turn into the trolley problem and deciding which lives you’re willing to sacrifice, but to be fair, I’m not totally sure if this show feels like it’s interesting either. It seems like arguments certain characters were making as a justification that we weren’t supposed to agree with. I cannot wait for the show to come back again so I can see where this wacky cliffhanger takes us.

## Misc notes

- This is my favorite genre of tv, "Keri Russell yelling at men"
- I am still cackling about the ending of this season, just cannot believe that just happened....Hal always fucks this up.
- I so rarely say this but 6 episodes is not enough for a season!
