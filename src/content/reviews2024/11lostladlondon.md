## Lost Lad London

I've started to lean towards short running manga since it's cheaper and less space intensive to collect, which is a big reason why I got Shima Shinya's two series, Lost Lad London and Glitch. Lost Lad London is an exploration of racism in a murder mystery as Al, a South Asian Londoner, is getting pinned for a murder he didn't commit. Shinya-sensei's art style is kind of deceptively simple: the paneling is contained within a few boxes for each page and isn't too detailed, but that simplicity is also its strength. The space is mostly taken over by dialogue and the emotional response of characters and it serves the narrative well. I also just really love the art style, it's so gorgeous.  
  
Of course, I am very happy to have space for progressive manga with interesting stories and perspectives that have not always found space in the medium before. Al and Ellis connect almost immediately because they both know what it's like to be immediately judged based on skin color in a society like modern day London and there are other characters with similar experiences that the series highlights. I'm a bit conflicted about the length of the series only being 3 volumes because it does seem to be enough for the story, but I also do think there were other characters that could've been explored more.  
  
## Misc notes
- That person being the killer is a bit brilliant because the arrogance fits so very well
- I know I already said this but GORGEOUS art!!!
- I'm waiting for Glitch to finish getting published in English, but I cannot wait to check out more of Shinya-sensei's work, their work feels so fresh
