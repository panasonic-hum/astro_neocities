I'm pretty sure the biggest reason I even checked out Pink was because [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsKJjfAZNZo) showed up on my youtube feed. I recommend checking out that video generally, but I think it's necessary for Pink because there was a lot of historical context I was just unaware of and they did a really great job with the video! I did enjoy the volume without that context, but I think the additional context about Japan's bubble economy and explaining the culture of "Office Lady" that limited the vocational track for women so they get married and quit working after a while.

As the back cover says, Pink is about love and capitalism; Yumi works in an office by day and as a sex worker by night to feed her croc. There is depth and layers to the manga, but not so much to be off putting and dense. The manga is a bit vulgar and cruel, but in an incredibly human way. Yumi and her step-mother are so cruel to each other, but in a way where it seems like they've grown up in a culture and society (by which I think I mean "being wealthy") that made them believe there was no other way to do things. Two women pitted against each other through the economic environment that gives them the choice to be kept at the lower rungs of an office job or get married and make being pretty your job. The story also has them play into the wicked step-mother trope in western fairytales, which are so intertwined with what is frequently our first introduction to love and romance, as twisted as those stories are.

## Misc notes

- I quite like the croc being a character and a metaphor for overconsumption, very cheeky
- Honestly, the whole story is pretty heavy on metaphors (the other one playing with the tropes of fairy tales) and I really enjoyed that, love a good metaphor
- There was a moment halfway through it where I realized the mangaka was probably a woman because the description of menstruation was too accurate to be written by a man
