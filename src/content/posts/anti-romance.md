## Anti-Romance

This was only two volumes and seemed interesting so I picked it up on a whim. Anti Romance was a mixed bag for me. The couple are childhood friends and roommates (*vine voice* and they were roommates) struggling to come to terms with the romantic feelings harbored between them. In the process, they hurt each other as these feelings have festered in a lot of unhealthy ways in the past 6 year. But truthfully, I didn't feel too invested in the main couple's story. Both Suou and Ryou have people they talk to about this relationship and those not-couples were once in a similar boat to them and offer advice about their own moments that came and went before they committed to a relationship. I found those stories of failures in communication and missing a window and having the rest of your life to regret it interesting and bittersweet. These secondary relationships did a great job contextualizing what Suou and Ryou had to lose if this moment passed them by, and I found them more interesting than the main characters.  
  
I do feel like this is maybe on me trying to find romances despite me being incredibly picky. There was just too much about the story I found frustrating, but generally the themes of Anti Romance did move me even if the execution didn't.  

### Misc notes

* I am still rooting for the two hair stylists...where's their series
* If this wasn't just 2 volumes, I don't think I would've finished it
