## Perfect Blue

I'm whatever the opposite of a movie buff is, but this trippy and fucked up hour and a half is the kind of movie I enjoy. It's grim as hell and made me reconsider my relationship to the entertainment industry, reminding me of the bleakest and most exploitative parts of the industry. Mima is a young woman miserably trapped in an industry that views her both as an object of chaste purity that young men can project their feelings and ideas of femininity onto as a pop idol and an aspiring actress that is expected to be an object of lust. She's neither, she's simply a woman pursuing a career, but the film does an incredible job of depicting this contradictory expectation of women under patriarchal society. The movie expresses the confusion and stress this puts Mima through in an incredible way that’s disorienting to the viewer but never too much. Well, maybe a bit “too much” but in a very story appropriate way. I kept wondering what was real but then considered that “what’s real” is a boring question to have for this movie. What does it matter what’s real when the scripted feels indistinguishable from real actions or genuine feelings brought on by them?  
  
I’ll be vague but I think I’m still not fond of the ending. It feels like a “twist” to get the audience on their heels more than a conclusion to the outcome of this sort of misogynistic violence. I’ll sit with it to see if that changes, but it felt like a flat way to end a fantastic movie.  

### Misc notes

* I have a pretty high tolerance for violence in media (I'm American after all), but woof this is truly tough
* I'm gonna have to break my "no movies" rule to check more Satoshi Kon because this film was incredible
* no but like, why was the ending like that
