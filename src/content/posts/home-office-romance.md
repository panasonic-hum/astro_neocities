## Home Office Romance  

Home Office Romance is a combination of two of the trickiest genres for me to enjoy: slice of life and romance. However, I adored this short read! I found Nokoru endearing in the way that straightforward nerds can be and it helps that I share a lot of his personality traits myself. I loved seeing all of Natsu and Nokoru's little interactions and seeing their relationship develop.  
  
Usually, COVID-19 era media stresses me out for obvious reasons, but using the global pandemic and the ways it completely changed how we live and work to show a positive outcome of two neighbors falling in love brought me joy to see. This is one of those mangas where you're bummed that it's so short.  
  
### Misc notes

* hold your shock but I related to the tech worker who's straightforward and logical  
* I need this series in english and in print!
